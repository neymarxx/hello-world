Report on Remote Sensing Image Analysis

(a)Overview Sentinel satellites and answer the following questions to understand the image used for this exercise.
1.When were Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 launched, respectively?
A: Sentinel-1 was launched on April 3, 2014; Sentinel-2 was launched on June 23, 2015.
2.How many bands are used by the Multispectral Instrument (MSI) on-board SENTINEL-2, and what are the central wavelength and spatial resolution of each band?
A:Multispectral instrument (MSI) covering 13 spectral bands (443nmâ€“2190nm) with a swath width of 290 km and spatial resolutions of 10 m (4 visible and near-infrared bands), 20 m (6 red-edge shortwave-infrared bands) and 60 m (3 atmospheric correction bands)




(b)Image display and enhancement
Type 1: Side-by-side

Comment : The image display by channel 1 ,channel 10 and channel 11 are mosaic , and the other 10 are clear and distinguish. Channel 6-9 are brighter than other 9 channels.

Type 2: 3-Channel Colour



(c)Ground truth
A: Vegetation, Buildings and Playground .
